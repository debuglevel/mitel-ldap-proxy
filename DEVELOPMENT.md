# Developer's notes

## tools usage

* `npm install` looks at `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and downloads all that stuff into `node_modules`.
    * `npm ci install` does basically the same, but removes `node_modules` which is nice for a clean CI/CD.
* `tsc` compiles TypeScript into JavaScript. It is configured by `tsconfig.json`.
* `node build/server.js` runs node (i.e. the JavaScript runtime) with the main .js-file (generated by `tsc`).

* `npm run-script build-serve` or `npm run build-serve` will run the command defined under `scripts.build-serve`
  in `package.json`.
* You probably want to run `npm run watch` or `npm run watch-debug` which continuously compiles TypeScript and restarts
  Node afterwards.

If a `scripts.start` would be defined, `npm start` (or `npm restart`) would run it. It's just a shortcut
for `npm run-script start`.
